    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>3 pounds flank steak</li>
        <li>½ cup soy sauce</li>
        <li>½ cup olive oil</li>
        <li>⅓ cup white vinegar</li>
        <li>4 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>2 limes, juiced</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground white pepper</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon chili powder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon dried oregano</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground cumin</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon paprika</li>
        <li>Corn tortillas</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Lay flank steak in a large glass baking dish.</li>
        <li>Make the marinade: Whisk soy sauce, oil, vinegar, 4 cloves of garlic, juice of two limes, salt, black pepper, white pepper, garlic powder, chili powder, oregano, cumin, and paprika together in a bowl until well blended; pour over steak, turning to coat both sides. Cover the dish with plastic wrap and marinate in the refrigerator for 1 to 8 hours.</li>
        <li>Remove steak from the marinade and shake off excess. Discard the remaining marinade. Cut the marinated flank steak into cubes or strips. Heat vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add steak; cook and stir until cooked through and most of the liquid has evaporated.</li>
        <li>Warm tortillas in a dry skillet over low heat for about a minute on each side.</li>
        <li>Place some steak on each tortilla; top with relish and prepared salsa. Sprinkle with cotija cheese. Garnish with lime wedges and serve.</li>
    </ol>
